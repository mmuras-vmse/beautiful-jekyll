    I usually access github from within Visual Studio Code.  As such, when I start coding a new project, I often need a reminder, or a cheat sheet for how to connect Visual Studio Code to a Git repository.  These notes are more for me than for anyone else, but I'm sharing them nonetheless.

        Steps:
            1. Create a directory on the local file system.
            2. Create a repo on Github.
            3. Select Clone "Clone or download" on Github, copy the link
            4. In Visual Studio Code, sect File -> Add Folder to Workspace -> Select the newly created directory
            5. Select Terminal Window
            6. In the window, type:
                git config --global user.name <github userID>

                git clone <URL from github link copied earlier>

                That should be all that's required.  any newly created file should be available on github after stage/commit/push.
